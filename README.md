# How to Contribute

The process to follow when contributing is to:

Raise an issue if there isnâ€™t one already. This can be for a bug or a feature. Give a detailed description about the problem, what were you expecting and what actually happened etc.
We can discuss new features in the issue to make sure that your PR is something I want to include on the site before you go and spend a long time working on a PR that might not get merged in.
- Fork the repository in your own GitHub account.
- Work on the code in a branch on your fork.
- Push your changes in your branch up to your repository.
- Create a PR back to the main repository that shows what the problem was, how you fixed it and what happens now.
- Hopefully I will be able to review the PR, test it out, and all being well, merge it in.

# uSync

When you get it running locally, you can install an empty Umbraco site and then click uSync in the settings section and then click on Full Import.

This should add all of the document types, content and media etc.
